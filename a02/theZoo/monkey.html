<p>Monkeys are highly social and intelligent primates, with species ranging from small tree-dwellers to larger ground-dwelling varieties. They are known for their agility, curiosity, and the use of their hands and prehensile tails to navigate through trees and manipulate objects. Monkeys are often found in tropical rainforests, although some species live in mountainous or arid regions. Their diet is varied, consisting of fruits, leaves, insects, and sometimes small animals. Many monkeys live in complex social groups, using vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language to communicate and maintain social bonds.</p>
