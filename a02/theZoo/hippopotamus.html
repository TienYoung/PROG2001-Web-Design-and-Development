<p>The hippopotamus is a massive, semi-aquatic mammal found in rivers, lakes, and swamps across sub-Saharan Africa. Despite their bulky appearance and seemingly docile nature, hippos are highly territorial and can be quite aggressive, particularly when defending their aquatic territory. They spend much of their day submerged in water to keep cool, emerging at night to graze on grass. With their thick skin, large bodies, and powerful jaws, hippos are well-adapted to both land and water environments. They play a key role in their ecosystems by creating paths through vegetation and shaping riverine environments.</p>
