<p>The tiger is one of the most iconic and powerful predators, recognized by its orange coat with bold black stripes. As the largest species of the cat family, tigers are solitary and territorial, inhabiting forests, grasslands, and wetlands. They are apex predators, primarily hunting large mammals such as deer and wild boar. Tigers are excellent swimmers and are often found near water, which they use both for cooling off and for hunting prey. Known for their strength, agility, and stealth, tigers are a symbol of wilderness and conservation efforts, as many subspecies face threats from habitat loss and poaching.</p>
