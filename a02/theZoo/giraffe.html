<p>Giraffes, the tallest land animals on Earth, are easily recognizable by their long necks, spotted coats, and towering legs. These gentle herbivores inhabit savannas and open woodlands in Africa, where they feed primarily on leaves from tall trees, particularly acacias. Their height allows them to reach foliage that other animals cannot. Giraffes have unique patterns of brown spots on their coats, with no two individuals having the same markings. Despite their size, giraffes are surprisingly graceful, moving with a slow, loping gait and occasionally breaking into a fast, awkward run when necessary.</p>
