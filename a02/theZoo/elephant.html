    <p>The elephant, the largest land animal on Earth, is known for its impressive size, strong social structure, and remarkable intelligence. Weighing several tons, these gentle giants possess long, flexible trunks used for breathing, grasping, and communication. Their thick, gray skin provides protection, while large ears help regulate body temperature. Elephants are herbivores, grazing on grass, leaves, and fruit. They are also known for their strong family bonds, particularly the matriarch-led herds of females and calves. Elephants play a crucial role in their ecosystems, aiding seed dispersal and creating clearings in forests.</p>
