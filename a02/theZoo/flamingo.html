<p>Flamingos are striking birds, known for their vibrant pink feathers, long, slender necks, and stilt-like legs that allow them to wade through shallow waters. They live in large colonies, often near lagoons or salt lakes, where they use their specialized beaks to filter-feed on algae, plankton, and small invertebrates. The pink coloration comes from the carotenoid pigments in their diet. Flamingos have a distinct and graceful posture, often seen standing on one leg, which is thought to help with body temperature regulation. Their social nature and unique appearance make them one of the most recognizable birds.</p>
